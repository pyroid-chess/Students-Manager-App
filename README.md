# 🎓 Students Manager  
  
**Students Manager** is a simple educational project built with **Python**.    
Its main purpose is to **manage a student group** with a clean graphical user interface (GUI) using `tkinter`.    
This project demonstrates basic CRUD operations for managing students and shows how to integrate traditional Python logic with a GUI.

## 💾 Data Persistence  
  
**How does it store the data?**  
  
- This project uses **In-Memory Serialization** (`pickle`) to store the list of students **inside the program memory only**.  
- The data **will persist as long as the program is running**.  
- **Note:** Once you close and re-open the app, the student list resets because no external files or databases are used.  
  
This approach is perfect for simple demos and educational use.
