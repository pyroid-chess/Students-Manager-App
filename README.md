# 🎓 Students Manager

**Students Manager** is a simple educational project built with **Python**.  
Its main purpose is to **manage a student group** with a clean graphical user interface (GUI) using `tkinter`.  
This project demonstrates basic CRUD operations for managing students and shows how to integrate traditional Python logic with a GUI.

## 💾 Data Persistence

**How does it store the data?**

- This project uses **In-Memory Serialization** (`pickle`) to store the list of students **inside the program memory only**.
- The data **will persist as long as the program is running**.
- **Note:** Once you close and re-open the app, the student list resets because no external files or databases are used.

This approach is perfect for simple demos and educational use.
